The kernel has a generic segmentation offload mechanism (called GSO) which is not limited to TCP. It turns out that performance improves even if the feature ([[TSO]]) is emulated in the driver . But GSO only works for data transmission, not reception. That limitation is entirely fine for broad classes of users; sites providing content to the net, for example, send far more data than they receive. But other sites have different workloads, and, for them, packet reception overhead is just as important as transmission overhead.
