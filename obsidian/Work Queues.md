(Linux Kernel Development Chapter 8)
In its most basic form, the work queue subsystem is an interface for creating kernel threads to handle work queued from elsewhere.These kernel threads are called worker threads. Work queues let your driver create a special worker thread to handle deferred work.The work queue subsystem, however, implements and provides a default worker thread for handling work.Therefore, in its most common form, a work queue is a simple interface for deferring work to a generic kernel thread.
The default worker threads are called events/n where n is the processor number; there is one per processor. For example, on a uniprocessor system there is one thread, events/0. A dual processor system would additionally have an events/1 thread.The default worker thread handles deferred work from multiple locations. Many drivers in the kernel defer their bottom-half work to the default thread. Unless a driver or subsystem has a strong requirement for creating its own thread, the default thread is preferred. Nothing stops code from creating its own worker thread, however.This might be advantageous if you perform large amounts of processing in the worker thread. Processor-intense and performance-critical work might benefit from its own thread.This also lightens the load on the default threads, which prevents starving the rest of the queued work.
