Non-uniform memory access (NUMA) systems are divided into nodes, each of which normally contains a number of CPUs and some memory. All of the memory in the system is addressable from any CPU, but access to memory attached to the local node will be significantly faster than access to memory on remote nodes. For this reason, the kernel goes out of its way to try to keep workloads and their memory on the same nodes, and there is an extensive set of system calls allowing applications to control where in the system their memory is placed.
